# Hub20

![Hub20](documents/imgs/header.JPG)

Hub20 is a numpad with a bunch of features you never knew you needed. They include:

- Left and Right handed layouts supported, along with a 4x5 1U grid enabling it to be used as a macropad.
- Two rotary encoders, enabling intuitive controls for a wide range of tools including CAD and photo / video editing.
- Inbuilt USB 2.0 Hub with Type-C connectors, allowing connection to other keyboards, memory sticks, wireless receivers and more!
- VIA and QMK compatibility, including a "macro" mode enabling the keys to be remapped on a host computer.
- 27 addressable RGB leds, including one under each key.

If this project looks familiar, it's because it contains all the best parts of [Hub16](https://github.com/joshajohnson/Hub16), with a few added extras.

## Project Status

Hardware is finalised and kits can be purchased from [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/joshajohnson/hub20-programmable-macro-numberpad/).

### Repo Contents

- `documents` contains all documentation and images for the project.
- `firmware` contains both the source and precompiled binaries for Hub20.
- `hardware` contains the KiCad design files for the keyboard.
- `josh-kicad-lib` is my personal KiCad parts library which contains many of the parts used.
- `scripts` contains a number of scripts used in the PCB design process.
- `mechanicals` contain the plate and case design for Hub20.
- `production` contains all the files required to produce the PCB. It also contains test scripts and jigs.
- `software` contains all the VIA config, along with template script to use Hub20 as a macropad with software on your computer.

### Notes on the USB Hub

The hub is a four port USB 2.0 Hub with Type-C connectors, aimed at allowing connection of keyboards, mice, memory sticks, wireless receivers, and other small devices (including a second Hub20!)  to your computer.

Due to cost and space constraints, the hub has some limitations. The hub **is not**:

- USB 3.x, Power Delivery, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, etc compatible. 
- Designed to charge your phone quickly. Only 100mA is guaranteed per port.
- Designed to work with power hungry devices such as spinning hard drives.
- Guaranteed to provide full USB 2.0 speeds and performance on all ports.

Might you be able to charge your phone whilst copying files at full speed of a spinning hard drive over a long cable? Maybe. However Hub20 is a numpad first, USB hub second, so if you are looking for a high performance device I'd suggest picking up a dedicated USB hub and just using Hub20 as a numpad.
